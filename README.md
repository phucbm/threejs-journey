# Three.js Journey - Lesson recap

I created this repository as a lesson's notebook while learning Three.js from Three.js Journey, an awesome course by Bruno Simon.

Please do not consider these as a whole (or part) of the lesson's content. 
They are just things that I think I should write down to remember. 

I also build a final result page for each lesson to quickly check my progress.

## Chapter 01 - Basics

### 04. Webpack

- An 3D object is also called a Mesh.
- A Mesh needs a Geometry and a Material.
- Use Camera to adjust the POV of the scene.
- Perspective is the default camera.
- A Camera needs an aspect ratio and an FOV (degree).
- A Renderer need width/height, where to render into, a camera to see and a scene with every mesh's in it.

### 05. Transform objects

- Use Group to control multiple Mesh at once.
- Position, Scale and Rotation is Vector3, so they can be assigned using `.set(x, y, z)`.
- The order of axes when doing rotation is IMPORTANT!
- Messy order could cause "gimbal lock", use `mesh.rotation.reorder('YXZ')` to set the correct order before doing any rotation changing.
- Quaternion <=> Rotation
- Use `AxesHelper` to show axes.
- Use `camera.lookAt(position)` to set focus on a position.

### 06. Animations

- Use `requestAnimationFrame` to update value => create animations.
- Different framerate on different devices could lead to **inconsistent animation's duration**.
- Workaround #1: create a deltaTime with `Date.now()`. **Delta time is the amount of milliseconds that elapsed since the previous tick**.
- Workaround #2: use `clock.getElapsedTime()`.
- Workaround #3: use GSAP.
- We can also use GSAP to perform the render process.

### 07. Cameras

- FOV: vertical height of the camera
- Near & Far: how close and how far the camera can see
- Do not use extreme value like 0.0001 and 99999 for near & far to prevent **z-fighting**
- Controlling camera with `mousemove` event or OrbitControls

### 08. Fullscreen and resizing

- Resize canvas:
    - Use CSS to set the canvas size
    - Use window `resize` event to update camera (aspect & updateProjectionMatrix) and renderer (size and pixel ratio).
- Stair effect issue: limit the `devicePixelRatio` using `renderer.setPixelRatio()` to gain a better and consistent performance.
- Pixel ratio: 2 is enough (retina), 3 is maximum.
- Fullscreen mode: using `canvas.requestFullscreen()` and `document.exitFullscreen()`, safari need webkit prefix.

### 09. Geometries

- Vertices (coordinates)
- Use `Float32Array`: to gain a better performance with custom geometries
- `THREE.BufferGeometry()`

ðŸ‘‰ [See final result](https://phucbm.github.io/threejs-journey/lessons/09/dist/)

### 10. Debug UI

- dat.GUI [github](https://github.com/dataarts/dat.gui) [examples](https://jsfiddle.net/ikatyang/182ztwao/)
- Each item in the debug panel is also called a "tweak"

ðŸ‘‰ [See final result](https://phucbm.github.io/threejs-journey/lessons/10/dist/)

### 11. Textures

- Load textures (images) using `THREE.TextureLoader()`
- If texture could be changed after init, set `texture.needsUpdate` to `true`
- Get UV coordinates at `geometry.attributes.uv`
- Texture filter
- Texture optimization
- Texture resources: [poliigon.com](poliigon.com), [3dtextures.me](3dtextures.me), [arroway-textures.ch](arroway-textures.ch)

### 12. Materials

- `material.opacity`, `material.alphaMap` need `material.transparent = true`
- `material.side = THREE.DoubleSide;` could slow down the performance
- `THREE.MeshNormalMaterial()`, `flatShading`
- `THREE.MeshStandardMaterial()`, `aoMap`, `uv2`

### 13. 3D Text

---

## Chapter 02 - Classic techniques

### 14. Lights

---

## Playground

This is not a part of the course.
I'm just pulling some crazy ideas out of my sweaty brain.

### The mess

- Milestone: after lesson #10
- Things in this mess: `gsap`, `OrbitControls`, `object.geometry.setDrawRange()`, `THREE.BufferGeometry()`
